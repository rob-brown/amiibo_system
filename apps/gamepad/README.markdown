# Gamepad

## Summary

The Gamepad code is able to emulate a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It
serves up a web interface on your local network to support loading amiibo.

## Assembly

You can build your hardware however you want. This repo includes two hardware
options.

1. A simple option based on the [Adafruit Joy Bonnet](joybonnet.markdown).

2. The [AmmoBox](ammobox.markdown), a built-from-scratch option including a
custom circuit board.
